# Gigalope

Gigalope is a personal workspace for tools, integrations, and experiments.

Most work here centers around developer tooling, editor integrations, and systems that favor composability and iteration. Repositories range from early prototypes to more polished packages. Some projects may eventually graduate into standalone tools or published packages.

## Areas of interest

- Lisp and Scheme
- Go (occasionally)
- Emacs tooling and packages
- Theme systems and palette synchronization
- Raspberry Pi and small hardware experiments
- Select web development projects

## Stability

Not all repositories here are production-ready. APIs may change, projects may be reworked, and some experiments may be abandoned.

Each repository should document its own intended use and maturity level.

## Contributing

Feedback, issues, and contributions are welcome where noted.  
If you’re unsure whether a repository is open to contributions, feel free to open an issue and ask.
